The command:
./scripts/setup_linux.sh --mjkey path-to-your-mjkey.txt --modify-bashrc
will not work if apt-get update command returns with error, so comment it out

sudo apt-get install python3.6-dev for missing header files

install mujoco-py separately with python3.6 pip install mujoco-py==2.0.2.9 --no-use-pep517

use python3.6 -m  pip install -e .[all,dev]

always check if the virtual env is activated (in Pycharm)


Python3.5
Moved to Python3.5 because was unable to compile PyKDl for Python3.6.

uninstalling sip from global 5.1.0. This caused the ccmake command that builds PyKDL
for Pythin3.5 to fail, but we already have the so file.

While compiling PyKDL according to https://github.com/orocos/orocos_kinematics_dynamics/issues/115, it was linking to
sip in /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages. This is the sip that should be imported by Python3.5 while importing PyKDL.

find_package(SIP) was not able to find Python3.6 sip, only the sip in /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages

Importing PyKDL compiled for Python3.5 in Python3.6 gives segmentation fault

Log for PyKDL compilation:
1. -DPYTHON_VERSION=3.5
2. disables the ROS related source command in bashrc file. Not sure if this is required.
3. Commented out the automatic Python discovery in CMakeLists file and directly specified as Python3.5
4. Commenetd out find_package(catking QUIET)
5. in ccmake gui make sure it is pointing to the dowloaded kdl lib source files and not the ros files.
